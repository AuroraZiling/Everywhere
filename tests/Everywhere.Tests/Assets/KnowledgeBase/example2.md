## **Product Report: "YAOYAN" — Ethical AI Companion System**

**Product Name**: YAOYAN (尧言)
**Developer**: Yuanjie Intelligence Technology Co., Ltd.
**Lead Architect**: Dr. Luo Bingchu
**Report Date**: May 2025
**Version**: 3.2.1 (Stable Release)

---

### **Executive Summary**

YAOYAN is an advanced ethical AI companion system designed to assist with real-time decision-making in complex domestic and social environments. Unlike traditional digital assistants, YAOYAN integrates moral reasoning frameworks and emotional feedback loops to function as a context-aware, value-sensitive agent. The system is primarily deployed in households, elder care facilities, and educational settings.

---

### **1. Product Objectives**

* Enable real-time, context-specific moral reasoning in human-AI interaction.
* Detect ethically ambiguous situations and provide intervention options.
* Serve as a non-authoritative guide for emotional and cognitive support.
* Improve long-term trust and psychological well-being among users.

### **2. Key Features**

| Feature Name             | Description                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ethical Event Engine** | Context-aware engine that triggers based on over 5,000 scenario archetypes.       |
| **Moral Feedback Loop**  | Enables the AI to revise behavior models based on user emotional feedback.        |
| **Discretion Matrix**    | Governs the AI’s response aggressiveness based on cultural and personal settings. |
| **Privacy-first Core**   | All data processed locally; no cloud storage without explicit user consent.       |
| **Emotion Resonance UI** | Visually and verbally responsive interface with empathetic voice synthesis.       |

---

### **3. Technical Architecture**

* **Language Model Base**: Fine-tuned variant of GPT-4.1 with a constrained ethical alignment layer.
* **Sensor Integration**: Compatible with most smart home ecosystems (IoT v2.1+).
* **Processing Unit**: Edge-optimized AI chip (YI-22) developed in-house for low-latency response.
* **Programming Framework**: Hybrid stack using Rust (core logic), Python (behavioral scripting), and Prolog (ethical decision tree logic).
* **Data Storage**: Fully encrypted on-device vault using zero-knowledge protocol.

### **4. Use Case Scenarios**

**Scenario A**:
*Elderly person forgets to turn off the stove*
→ YAOYAN identifies anomaly → Cross-references time-of-day + cognitive profile → Issues gentle verbal reminder → Escalates to emergency alert if no response in 60 seconds.

**Scenario B**:
*Teenager shows signs of stress and isolation*
→ YAOYAN analyzes facial micro-expressions over 3 days → Initiates mood-enhancing interaction → Suggests parental discussion or seeks remote counselor link (if permissions exist).

---

### **5. Ethical Design Notes**

YAOYAN is built under the principles of “Cognitively Grounded Ethics” (CGE), meaning the AI is not prescriptive but advisory. Moral decisions remain in the hands of users, with the AI serving as a reflective prompt.

Dr. Luo Bingchu emphasizes:

> “True intelligence does not impose answers; it invites better questions.”

All modules have passed internal audits based on the AI Moral Safety Index (AMSI-4) and are compliant with China’s AI Governance Act (2024), GDPR (EU), and the California Digital Responsibility Statute.

### **6. Performance Metrics (Q1–Q2 2025)**

| Metric                         | Value         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------- |
| Active installations           | 412,300 units |
| Average daily active users     | 3.7M sessions |
| Average response latency       | 1.2 sec       |
| Critical intervention accuracy | 96.4%         |
| Reported privacy incidents     | 0 (audited)   |
| User emotional trust rating    | 4.83 / 5      |

---

### **7. Known Limitations**

* **Cultural Sensitivity**: Though customizable, certain moral frames require user adaptation in multicultural households.
* **False Positives in Ambiguity Detection**: 1.9% rate of over-alerting in highly dynamic environments.
* **Emotional Mimicry Fatigue**: Long-term users may grow desensitized to voice/emotional resonance; solution in development.

---

### **8. Roadmap**

* **Q3 2025**: Introduction of multilingual empathy layers (Japanese, Spanish, Arabic)
* **Q4 2025**: Open SDK for third-party ethical modules
* **2026**: Expansion to healthcare triage environments (Phase 1 trials in Zhejiang and Bavaria)

### **Appendices**

* **Appendix A**: Ethics Architecture White Paper (Restricted Access)
* **Appendix B**: Full Compliance Audit Logs (abridged)
* **Appendix C**: Interview with Dr. Luo on “Emotional AI and the Illusion of Autonomy”
